## Overview of SEAWAT

SEAWAT is a generic MODFLOW/MT3DMS-based computer program designed to simulate three-dimensional variable-density groundwater flow coupled with multi-species solute and heat transport. The program has been used for a wide variety of groundwater studies including those focused on brine migration in continental aquifers as well as those focused on saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers. SEAWAT uses the familiar structure of MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Thus, most of the commonly used pre and post-processors can be used to create SEAWAT datasets and visualize results. The MODFLOW concepts of "packages" and "processes" are retained in SEAWAT, which allows the program to work with many of the MODFLOW-related software programs, such as MODPATH, ZONEBUDGET, and parameter estimation programs. SEAWAT is a public domain computer program. The source code and software are distributed free of charge by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

SEAWAT Version 4 is a replacement for SEAWAT-2000. SEAWAT-2000 users are encouraged to use this new version, even if the new features are not required for a particular application. SEAWAT Version 4 is backward compatible with datasets created for SEAWAT-2000 and, therefore, SEAWAT-2000 is no longer supported or maintained.
